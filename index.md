### Interest and Hobbies

I'm currently working on a DIY HomeServer project, primarily for home automation purposes and automatically backing up multiple files across various devices. Additionally, I'm delving into cybersecurity concepts as I introduce myself to the field. I've been tinkering with technology since elementary school, starting with basic scripted tasks. Currently, I'm enrolled in an online training program with the goal of obtaining the CPTS certificate from Hack The Box by the end of 2024. In addition to these activities, I'm also practicing my documentation skills with Obsidian and his concept relating system, while using Markdown for writing down notes(Hehe, this cv is kinda sus).
